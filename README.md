<h1>🎮 Python Mini Games Collection</h1>

A collection of fun, interactive terminal-based games built with Python. These projects demonstrate the use of loops, conditionals, and random library integration.

 🕹️ Games Included
<h2>1🎮 Number Guessing Game (Python)</h2>

A simple interactive game where the computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess it.

 📝 About the Code
This script demonstrates:
Random Logic: Uses the `random` library to generate a number between 1 and 100.
Error Handling: Uses `try-except` to prevent the program from crashing if a user types text instead of a number.
Loops: Uses a `while` loop to keep the game running until the correct answer is found.

 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
 <h2>2. ✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors (`rock_paper_scissor.py`)</h2>
The classic game where you compete against the computer. Will you win, lose, or draw?
Key Concept: Logic handling and list manipulation.
